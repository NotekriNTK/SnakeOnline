The purpose of this project is to recreate the game Snake but with a twist.
This is going to be an interpretation of Snake, where the purpose is no longer
to try and beat your own record, but rather to make sure you get the highest score
in the current game session.

Interpretation:
The game is classic Snake but with multiple players [multiplayer].
The goal of the game is to have the highest score by the when alle players have died.
You get die when you collide with either a wall or a player body-part.
If two players run into each other, both players die.

Main goals:
    - Recreate the classic game Snake
    - Make it multiplayer to add a twist
    - Make a functional arena mode

Extra goals:
Make more gamemodes;
    - make the edges function as a portal to the other edge
    - customizable arena size
    - add a highscore system
    - add a stattracker with wlr, kda, wins, losses and winstreak
